Java script:
1.	Java script is a scripting language.
2.	It is given by Netscape.
3.	Current version of js is ES13 (Ecma script).
4.	We can include js code in html by using <script></script>
5.	It is used to develop angular , recat , viewjs based application
6.	It provides dynamic functionalities to web pages
7.	We can save java script file with .js extension.
8.	Recommended IDE for JS is VS code.



How many ways we can execute a javascript:
1.	Interpreter  (Browser engine)
2.	Node Tool present in Node js


By default js execution is synchronous


Netscape provides so many ready made objects like date , window , time , document , console and etc… 
Thatswhy we can say it is a object based scripting language.


Installations of software:
1.	Download and install Node js

Website :- https://nodejs.org/en/download/

File - node-v16.15.1-x64.msi

2.	download and VSCODE 
website:- https://code.visualstudio.com/download
file:- 


Execution of javascript:

Node  file.js

(it will automatically execute filename.js file)


Variables:

Variables are used to store the data.

Eg: 
String
Number
Boolean

……..

How to declare variables:

By three ways:

1.	Var
2.	Let
3.	Const
           
                Identifier declaration should contains:
       
a)	 a – z
A – Z
0-	9
_ underscore
$ dollar
Note : we can not start ant identifier (variables) with digits.
Syntax:

Var/let /const          variablename    =    value;

Var   message  =  ”Good Evening Everyone”;

String:-
Sequence of characters within double quotes, single quotes and backtick.

Double quotes=”javascript”
Single quotes=’python’
Backtick=`java`  added   ES6 V

Var msg=”welcome to bytecode”;

Var  instituteName=”bytecode it solutions”;

Var wishMsg=`Good Evening !!! Welcome to  ${ instituteName }`;
Console.log(wishMsg);

Hexadecimal   0x
Octal  0o
Binary0b

Boolean:

True---1
False ---0

Bigint:
Var any_number=21347632846873648763284588888888888888346344444444444444232222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222777777777777777777777777777777n;



Array:
We can represent an array with square bracket [].
Var   array_one=[“java”, “python”, “php”];

JSON:
Javascript object notations.
Used to transfer data over network.

We can represent with { ‘key’:”values” , “key2”:”value2”} in the form key and values.

Var object_one={“subject_one”: “ReactJS” , “sub_two”:”javascript”,”subject_three”: “Nodejs”};










Functions:
  Functions are used to define business logic and reuse that business logic.

Types of functions:
a)	Named functions
b)	Anonymous functions
c)	Rest parameters in functions
d)	Default parameters in functions
e)	Optional parameters in functions
f)	Generators
g)	Constructors
h)	IIFE


Named functions:
The functions with a particular name called named functions.

Syntax:

function  functionName(parameters){

      //  Business logic

}

Function calling:

functionName(arg1,arg2,arg3…);



b)	Anonymous functions:
------------------------
The function without name is called Anonymous functions.

Anonymous functions also called as arrow function / lambda functions / callback functions.

we can represent Anonymous function as =>.

it is introduced in ES-6.

syntax:
  
  function definition


  var / let / const  variablename= (arg1,arg2,arg3.....)=>{

       // business logic
  }

    function calling:

    variablename(param1, param2,param3,....);


   Note:- if we have only one statement of code then curly brackets and return statement is optional.
